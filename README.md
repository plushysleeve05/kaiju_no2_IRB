# Ashesi Institutional Review Board (IRB) Management System
Project Overview
The Ashesi Institutional Review Board (IRB) Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of reviewing and approving research proposals at Ashesi University. It provides functionalities for researchers, administrators, and reviewers to manage submissions, track the review process, and ensure compliance with ethical standards.

A key feature of this system is the integration of a trained OpenAI API model, which reviews research papers and proposals, providing insightful comments and feedback to enhance the quality of submissions.

Features
User Authentication: Secure login and signup functionalities for different user roles (researchers, administrators, reviewers).
Proposal Submission: Researchers can submit proposals for review, along with necessary documents.
Automated Review with AI: The system utilizes a trained OpenAI API model to automatically review submitted research papers and proposals, offering comments and suggestions.
Review Process: Administrators and reviewers can view, comment on, and approve or reject submissions.
Dashboard: Custom dashboards for researchers and administrators to manage their tasks.
Plagiarism Check: Integrated plagiarism checking for submitted documents.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive and user-friendly.
Installation
Prerequisites
PHP: Ensure PHP is installed on your server.
MySQL: A MySQL database is required to store user data and proposal information.
Web Server: Apache or any other web server that supports PHP.
OpenAI API Key: A valid OpenAI API key is required for the AI-based review functionality.

Usage
For Researchers
Submit Proposals: Upload your research proposals and related documents.
Track Status: View the status of your submissions and any feedback provided.
For Administrators
Review Proposals: Manage and review submitted proposals.
Manage Users: Add or remove users and assign roles.
